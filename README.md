# Lego Mario Controller

This is a small python script that connects to a Lego Mario toy and emits keystrokes for certaim movements of the figurine. I used it as a controller for Super Mario Brothers (Video)[https://twitter.com/r1ckp/status/1301074026975162368]

I only tested it on MacOS 10.15 - it may or may not work on other opererating systems. I had to run the NES emulator in a Linux VM (Parallels or VirtualBox) because the native emulators on MacOS did ignore the virtual keypresses from python.
